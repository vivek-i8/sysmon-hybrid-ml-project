# utils/

This folder contains helper utility scripts used by the rest of the project.

Team Members Responsible:
- Member 1 (Dataset & Tokenizer)
- Member 3 (Training utilities if needed)

Files that will be added later:
- dataset.py     → PyTorch Dataset/Dataloader
- tokenizer.py   → Tokenizer or text processing utilities

Shared helper scripts (used by both models and training code) will go here.
